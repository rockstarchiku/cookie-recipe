      <p>This recipe is from my dad and they are a favorite among friends and family.
         The secret ingredient is the coconut! <em>Be warned</em>, these will fly off of the plate!</p>
      <h3> History of cookies </h3>
      <p>Most people don't know the complicated past of the cookie.</p>
      <p>Cookies were first made after sugar became available as a baking ingredient about 1400 years ago.
         They were an enhancement to grain and water based breads made as early as 10,000 years ago. Persian bakers added sugar to bread recipes to create sweet cakes that baked in a clay oven fueled by dry wood fires.
         Because it was hard to estimate baking temperatures in that kind of oven, small amounts of cake batter, placed inside at intervals, determined the best time to start cooking the full-sized cakes.
         Eventually, those small "test" cakes became a delicacy in their own right, and today we know them as cookies, the Dutch word for "little cake.</p>
